    /*Problem Statement

You are given a square matrix of size NÃ—N. Can you calculate the absolute difference of the sums across the main diagonal and the secondary diagonal?

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer N. The next N lines contain the rows of N integers describing the matrix.

Output Format

Output a single integer equal to the absolute difference in the sums across the diagonals.

Sample Input

3
11 2 4
4 5 6
10 8 -12
Sample Output

15
Explanation

The main diagonal of the matrix is:

11
    5
        -12
Sum across the first diagonal: 11 + 5 - 12 = 4

The secondary diagonal of the matrix is:

        4
    5
10
Sum across the second diagonal: 4 + 5 + 10 = 19
Difference: |4 - 19| = 15*/
